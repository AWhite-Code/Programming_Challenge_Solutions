## Naming Conventions

Each solution file is named according to a specific convention that includes the platform, problem number, problem name, and the main algorithm or data structure used. Here are the conventions for each platform:

- **LeetCode**: `LC-[problem number]-[problem name]-[algorithm/DS used].ext`
  - Example: `LC-23-MergeKSortedLists-PQ.py` (PQ stands for Priority Queue)

- **HackerRank**: `HR-[problem number]-[problem name]-[algorithm/DS used].ext`
  - Example: `HR-45-SherlockAndAnagrams-HashTable.py`

- **Codeforces**: `CF-[contest number]-[problem name]-[algorithm/DS used].ext`
  - Example: `CF-1365A-MatrixGame-Greedy.cpp`

- **GeeksforGeeks**: `GFG-[problem name]-[algorithm/DS used].ext`
  - Example: `GFG-DetectCycle-Graph.py`

- **Exercism**: `[language]-[exercise name].ext`
  - Example: `Python-ListOps.py`

- **Project Euler**: `PE-[problem number]-[problem name]-[algorithm/DS used].ext`
  - Example: `PE-101-PrimeSummation-Math.py`
